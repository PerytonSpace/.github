## About us
Peryton Space is a student-led rocketry and satellite team at the University of Surrey. We are passionate about space exploration and education, and we are committed to developing innovative technologies and inspiring the next generation of aerospace engineers or space engineers who will work in the space sector.

Our team consists students from a variety of disciplines, including engineering, physics, mathematics, among others. We design, build, and launch rockets, and also develop new technologies for the space industry, such as space-based electronics and satellite systems.

We are also committed to inspiring the next generation of space engineers. We run a variety of outreach programs, including workshops, talks, and demonstrations.
